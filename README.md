People Analytics Using R â€“ Employee Churn

In this project I will demonstrate how to build, evaluate and deploy your predictive turnover model, using R. I calculate past rates or turnover in an attempt to predict future turnover rates. 
The following questions are among the ones I would like to answer:

What proportion of our staff is leaving?

Where is it occurring?

How does Age and Length of Service affect termination?

What, if anything, else contributes to it?

Can we predict future terminations?

If so, how well can we predict?
